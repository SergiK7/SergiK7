# Hi 👋🏻 I'm Sergi Carapuig
## I'm a data scientist with passion for technology, AI and sustainability 
### I believe that in order to make better decisions that have a positive impact we should base them on data

* #### 🏋🏻‍♂️ I'm currently working on [BandIt](https://github.com/SergiK7/BandIt) 🎸 🥁
  A generative AI model that creates music utilizing transformers architecture.<br>
  More specifically, you give it guitar tracks and it generates corresponding drums track.<br>
  In the future I intend to include more musical instruments.

* #### 👯‍♂️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that use data science for the greater good 🌳
